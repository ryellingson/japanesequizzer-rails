## Katakana 1

**おめでとう** **Congratulations!**

You are about to level up in your understanding of Japanese.

あ -> ア

Katakana is primarily used for words of foreign origin.

Just like hiragana, katakana has **46** characters that can be represented in other languages through romanized characters called **romaji**.

 | Hiragana | Romaji |
 | ----------  | ----- |
 | ア　-> | a |
 | カ　-> | ka |
 etc...

 Your goal is to match the katakana to their romaji, just hit **PLAY** to get started.

You can skip an answer you don't know with the **back** and **next** buttons, or with the **arrows** on your keyboard.

Try to get everyone right for a **bonus**!!!

がんばって!!!
