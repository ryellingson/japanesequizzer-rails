## Ultimate Hiragana

**すごい!!** **:scream:**

You are about to take the ultimate hiragana challenge.

As well as dakuten ( ﾞ) and handakuten ( ﾟ) now we deal with
ようおん (youon).

It will be tough, but you can do it!

 | Hiragana | Romaji |
 | ----------  | ----- |
 | ぴょ　-> | pyo |
 | しゅ　-> | shu |
 etc...

 Your goal is to match the hiragana to their romaji, just hit **PLAY** to get started.

You can skip an answer you don't know with the **back** and **next** buttons, or with the **arrows** on your keyboard.

Try to get everyone right for a **bonus**!!!

がんばって!!!
