## Emotions and feelings

Time to talk about our emotions in Japanese!

 | Icon | Romaji | Kana | Kanji |
 | ----------  | -- | -- | --|
 | :slightly_smiling_face:　-> | ureshii | うれしい | 嬉しい |
 | :slightly_frowning_face:　-> | kanashi | かなしい | 悲しい |
 etc...

 Your goal is to match the icon to its Japanese word, in either **romaji**, **kana**, or even **kanji**.

 Just hit **PLAY** to get started!

You can skip an answer you don't know with the **back** and **next** buttons, or with the **arrows** on your keyboard.

Try to get everyone right for a **bonus**!!!
