## Animals

Time to practice your animals in Japanese!

 | Icon | Romaji | Kana | Kanji |
 | ----------  | -- | -- | --|
 | :dog:　-> | inu | いぬ | 犬 |
 | :frog:　-> | kaeru | かえる | 蛙 |
 etc...

 Your goal is to match the icon to its Japanese word, in either **romaji**, **kana**, or even **kanji**.

 Just hit **PLAY** to get started!

You can skip an answer you don't know with the **back** and **next** buttons, or with the **arrows** on your keyboard.

Try to get everyone right for a **bonus**!!!

がんばって!!!
