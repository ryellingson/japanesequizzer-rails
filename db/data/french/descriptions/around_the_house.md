## Around the house

Time to learn some household items in Japanese!

Your goal is to match the icon to its Japanese word, in either **romaji**, **kana**, or even **kanji**.

| Icon | Romaji | Kana | Kanji |
| ----------  | -- | -- | --|
| 👞　-> | kutsu | くつ | 靴 |
| 👓　-> | megane | めがね | 眼鏡 |

etc...

Just hit **PLAY** to get started!

You can skip an answer you don't know with the **back** and **next** buttons, or with the **arrows** on your keyboard.

Try to get everyone right for a **bonus**!!!

がんばって!!!
