## Tech and tools

---

Time to practice your **tech and tools** vocabulary in French!

Your goal is to match the **icon** to its French **word**.

| Icon | Word | 
| ---- | ---- |
| ðŸ”¨ã€€->  | le marteau |
| ðŸ”§ã€€->  | la clÃ© |

etc...

Careful about **articles (le, la)** and **accent marks**.

Remember on your keyboard: 
option + e + e = Ã©
option + ` + e = Ã¨
option + c = Ã§
option + i + e = Ãª
option + u + e = Ã«
option + q = Å“

etc...

Just hit **PLAY** to get started!

You can skip an answer you don't know with the **back** and **next** buttons, or with the **arrows** on your keyboard.

Try to get everyone right for a **bonus**!!!

Bonne chance!!!
