## Food

---

Let's practice our foods in Japanese!

Your goal is to match the icon to its Japanese word, in either **romaji**, **kana**, or even **kanji**.

| Icon | Romaji | Kana | Kanji |
| ----------  | -- | -- | --|
| üç£„ÄÄ-> | sushi | „Åô„Åó | ÂØøÂè∏ |
| üç°„ÄÄ-> | dango | „Å†„Çì„Åî | Âõ£Â≠ê |

etc...

Just hit **PLAY** to get started!

You can skip an answer you don't know with the **back** and **next** buttons, or with the **arrows** on your keyboard.

Try to get everyone right for a **bonus**!!!

„Åå„Çì„Å∞„Å£„Å¶!!!
