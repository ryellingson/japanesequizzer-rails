## Nature and weather

---

Time to practice your **nature and weather** vocab in Spanish!

Your goal is to match the **icon** to its Spanish **word**.

| Icon | Word | 
| ---- | ---- |
| ðŸŒ§ã€€->  | la lluvia |
| ðŸŒ»ã€€->  | el girasol | 

etc...

Careful about **articles (el, la)** and **accent marks**.

Remember on your keyboard: 
option + e + a = Ã¡
option + e + i = Ã­
option + n + n = Ã±
etc...

Just hit **PLAY** to get started!

You can skip an answer you don't know with the **back** and **next** buttons, or with the **arrows** on your keyboard.

Try to get everyone right for a **bonus**!!!

Buena suerte!!!
